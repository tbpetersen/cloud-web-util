  This login page is used to authorize requests. A username and password is
  exchanged for a token that can be sent with the authorization header of
  http requests. The login page exchanges the username and password provided
  for a token that is then stored in the browser's localStorage as "loginToken"
  ( or a cookie names "loginToken" if localStorage is not available ). The 
  login page redirects to
  https://holonet.sdsc.edu:8134/projectCreation/createProject.html by default.
  To change which page it redirects to, pass the address as a url parameter
  named "redirectURL" .

    Ex. 
      https://holonet.sdsc.edu:8134/projectCreation/createProject.html?redirectURL=www.example.com
      This will cause the login page to redirect to www.example.com after authentication.

  To use the token, one would then access the local storage of the browser
  after authentication. Add the token to the "Authorization" header of the
  request.
